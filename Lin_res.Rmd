```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We want to predict Ceres scores of our drivermutations ("ERBB2","MYCBP", "PARP10", "PIK3CA") based on data we got from second site targets wright ?
for this we need a data frame for every drivermutation, consisting of ceres scores from our SSTs. 
rownames -> SSTs
colnames -> BCCL containing this driver mutation ( we can discuss this :))


```{r}
SSTs <- c(SST_cand_ERBB2[,0]) #could be any list of SSTs
LinResdf0 <- subset(BCCL_kd.ceres, BCCL_kd.ceres[,0] == SSTs) #df, consisting 28 col, nSTTs rows
# stillsearching for command :)drivmutCL <- c(BCCL_Mutation["Hugosymbol"" == "ERBB2" ])
LinResdf1 <- subset(LinResdf0, colname == drivmutCL)
```
