## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
BCCL_ExpressionTHR <- BCCL_Expression
BCCL_ExpressionTHR[BCCL_ExpressionTHR > 5] = 5 # Thresholding
boxplot(BCCL_ExpressionTHR, xlab = "Genes expressed in cell", ylab ="Transcripts per million")
boxplot(BCCL_Expression[,c("333", "409", "532")], xlab = "Genes expressed in cell", ylab ="Transcripts per million")
boxplot(BCCL_ExpressionTHR[,c("333","406","532")])
```
*problem: there are cell lines with more than a half non expressed genes
```{r}
summary(BCCL_Expression)
# insert command to find cell lines with median == 0 automatically
BCCL_Expressionfresh <- BCCL_Expression[, c(1:3, 5:26)]
boxplot(BCCL_Expressionfresh) #-> stupid
```
